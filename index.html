            <h3>Favorite Person,</h3>
            <p>
              Always look for a favorite person for you, sit with him for a long time, 
              do not think about anything at the time, in those moments just think of every 
              happy moment you had, tell this person about it and laughter, you do not know 
              what this session with this friend will do to you, may You're like a volcano 
              about to erupt, but after a small talk like this with a best friend you might 
              make a raging volcano a river still.

            <h3>Not Only Places!</h3>
            <p>
              Relaxation does not need places only, you may find relaxation in 
              isolation away from the noise in your room for a short period, 
              you may also find it in walking at night with a friend, lover or close person, 
              you just need a period in which to reconsider yourself, yourself need sympathy, 
              Never try to leave yourself for long periods without rest, as in a 
              balloon, if you let it take in air more than its energy, this will lead to its 
              explosion, as well as your soul and body, do not carry them more than 
              their energy, they are like children who need special care, be like a father and mother to them.

            <p>
              Try not to hide a lot of sadness in yourself, talk to someone or 
              even to yourself, don't let sadness control you, everything that 
              happens to us in our life must have a good side for it, we can't bear 
              all these troubles, try hard to bring pleasure to your heart,
              Every bad time has to come and pass,
              just try to stay strong and don't give up easily, an ant can carry twice its weight, be strong.

            <p class="last">
              The most difficult times we go through are because of sadness, and sadness 
              is more painful when it comes from a person close to you, you may find 
              comfort and relaxation also when you get rid of this sadness, a session 
              with the person close to me to clear things up is enough to adjust the 
              mood and feel comfortable, so if there is someone Close to you, try to 
              initiate it and enjoy some spiritual serenity for a better life.
